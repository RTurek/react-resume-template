## Overview

I'll be working on building my resume in React.js for fun and to test out some new tools and tech.

Anyone can copy this repo and replace all of my resume content with their own. It's built to share (or it will be when it's complete)!

## Tech & Libraries
_Things I'm playing around with for this project just to learn and practice..._
- React.js
- Material-UI
- Semantic HTML
- styled-components (css-in-js)
- tailwindcss (utility based css)
- Storybook
- (maybe) TypeScript
- (maybe) Custom HTML Elements (web components)

## Startup

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```
